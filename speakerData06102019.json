OAuth and OpenID Connect are standards-based protocols for identity and access management in applications. In this presentation, we will take an existing Vue application and implement authentication with OIDC, discover several idiomatic ways to integrate authentication, user profile consumption and conditional formatting with Vue as well as consuming a secure backend with OAuth."

        "talkAbstract": "Everybody using React in 2019 knows something about JSX. It's that weird XML-esque syntax that we embed directly into our javascript files. To begin with we hate it, then we learn to put up with it, then one morning the real stockholm syndrome kicks in and we wake knowing the truth: JSX has truly worked its way into our hearts.\n\nAt PayPal, almost every dev team has adopted React in some way. But we've also started to realize that JSX is hugely powerful even when React is out of the picture.\n\nThis talk is a love-letter to JSX. It's about how what started as a simple compile-to-javascript templating language, has transformed how we render user-experiences in a functional way. It's about the weird and wonderful things you can use JSX for. And it's about how JSX has grown in usefulness beyond the role it plays in React."

There are now tools that allow this to happen!  In this session you will learn what web components are, get a view of some of the tools available to export Angular/Vue/React components, and see code examples of mixing exported components within other frameworks and vanilla HTML/JavaScript.\n\nCreating web components from your framework code may have some nice benefits depending on your project.  Some example use cases include:\n* Use existing components in one framework with another framework (use Angular components inside of React or Vue).\n* Provides a piecemeal migration path from an older framework to a new one.  For example, embedding Angular within AngularJS.\n* Embed web components inside of other technologies like a CMS or server side rendering technology.\n\nAlthough some of these tools are relatively new and still under development, it presents an exciting glimpse of what it may be like one day to have a more generic and open web."

What if we could develop an application, without users downloading library features that we don't use?\nSvelte isn't an ordinary component framework; rather, it's a build-time compiler that converts your component source code into efficient, compact JavaScript. If you don't use a particular feature of Svelte, it simply melts away, and your users don't have to download it.\nIn this talk, I will show how to develop a simple Svelte application, and how easy it is to build something is both impressive, but compact.\n"

        "talkAbstract": "For a long time, JavaScript was missing any kind of processing threads. While the single-threaded model added to developer comfort, it also made the platform unable to do serious and time-consuming calculations, and the only way to circumvent it was to do it on a remote server.\n\nLuckily, with the introduction and widespread adoption of Web Workers, we can now do resource-intensive calculations on background threads. A Web Worker allows you to run JavaScript in the background, without affecting the performance of the page. Even if you are running really resource intense code in the browser, you can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the Web Worker runs in the background.\n\nIn this talk, we will explore:\n\n* Web Workers, how and when you can use them, and their peculiarities.\n* Perf and framerate benefits (with data!)\n* Polyfilling for naughty browsers\n* Future: WebGL, Canvas2D, and other marvels browser vendors are cooking up."

This talk covers how GraphQL - a standard that unifies server and client communication - comes to save the day, and why the tooling around it is a game-changer.\n\nWe will answer the following questions. What is the philosophy behind GraphQL? How do you architect a scalable schema? How can GraphQL boost productivity? How can you avoid common pitfalls?\n\nWe will then get a GraphQL server up and running together while focusing on exploring real-world patterns for architecting our schema. We will discuss and implement practical steps to improve query performance, error handling and caching. By the end of this talk, you will leave with a working GraphQL server while we explore real-world patterns."

Add to that a very specific terminology and you get a spec that is barely understandable for a lot of people. The learning curve to OAuth is quite steep and that is part of the reason why a lot of developers donโt bother implementing it. However, understanding the basics will make you life as a developer so much simpler. In this talk, the presenter will try to explain the basic principles of OAuth in simple terms and, hopefully, in a way that is easy to understand for the real software developers that donโt necessarily have a passion for security.\n"

        "talkAbstract": "For a number of years now we have been hearing about all of the benefits that automated unit testing provides like increasing our quality, catching errors earlier, ensuring that all developers are testing in the same manner and deploying updates with high confidence that nothing will break. Testing a Web UI though was difficult and fragile which meant that typically we had no automated unit test for our Web UI. This is no longer the case with the latest release of Angular. Unit testing is now a first class citizen in Angular. \n\nOut of the box, the project generated by the Angular CLI has unit testing setup with Karma and Jasmine and includes sample tests. Generating new components, services, and pipes includes the unit test Spec file already wired up. Thus allowing you to focus on writing your unit tests and not on the infrastructure needed to get them running. The barriers to writing unit test have been destroyed. \n\nThis talk will walk through getting started unit testing your Angular components, services, and pipes. Along the way I will share the tips and tricks that I have learned as I have implemented unit testing on my Angular projects at a Fortune 100 company. You will walk away ready to immediately implement unit testing on your Angular project."

It acts as a wrapper around all of your events, so you can use the same patterns for any event, regardless of source.  RxJS also works seamlessly with every major state management tool, so the skills you learn in one area transfer to the next.  You'll learn about observables, how to upgrade your existing tooling to take advantage of RxJS and why RxJS is the best solution to deal with asynchronous state management."

        "talkAbstract": "More often than not developers fall into the trap of wanting to use some shinny trend heard in the IT world and that is no different with web components. Do you really understand the design decisions behind the concept of web components? In this talk weโll take a deep dive into what it is all about.\n\nIn the last few years the term web components have become a main stay in frontend development and web development at large. This popularity as usual tends to come with a huge adoption in the industry albeit without people actually understanding the core concepts behind this new frenzy theyโve encountered. This isnโt limited to juniors alone. The goal of this talk is to give a deep dive into the background behind components, where it came from, how it has evolved and possibly what we might see in the future."

        "talkAbstract": "Did you know thereโs a widely-supported browser API that allows you to interface with a wide variety of hardware, including some you can build yourself? Wonder no more and meet the WebMIDI API! Weโll look at how MIDI โ a niche protocol from 1983 designed for electronic musical instruments to talk to one another โ JavaScript and โtiny computersโ like the Arduino, Espruino and RasperryPi can be used to build interactive, non-musical experiences that straddle the line between the web and physical world.\n\n\n# For Reviewers\n\nThe theme of this talk is to explore a somewhat obscure browser API intended for interacting with music hardware via JavaScript and how it can be a great way for frontend & JavaScript developers to \"dip their toes\" into hardware programming and IoT concepts. It's really quite a bit of fun and tends to spur attendee's imaginations, based on the feedback I've received. I'm always pleased when someone who saw my talk reaches out to share something interesting they've made!\n\nThe general outline for the talk typically looks like this:\n\n- Brief introduction about me and my talk\n- Brief introduction to Rasperry Pis/C.H.I.P. and other \"tiny\" computers.\n- Brief talk on the evolution of Node along that same timeline.\n- Brief talk about MIDI, what it solved\n- Brief talk about why MIDI and the event-driven nature of Node compliment one another.\n- A look at some of the packages and projects that make MIDI interfacing easy in Node.\n- Why it dovetails nicely with Node and also the Internet of Things\n- Why I chose this stack and decided to talk about it: background in music, interesting use for recycled music equipment.\n- Examples of IoT projects I've made using this tech stack of Tiny Computer, MIDI and JavaScript (#1)\n- Examples of IoT projects I've made using this tech stack of Tiny Computer, MIDI and JavaScript (#2)\n- Examples of IoT projects I've made using this tech stack of Tiny Computer, MIDI and JavaScript (#3)\n- Examples of IoT projects I've made using this tech stack of Tiny Computer, MIDI and JavaScript (#4)\n- Examples of IoT projects I've made using this tech stack of Tiny Computer, MIDI and JavaScript (#5)\n- A breakdown of how I'm using this stack to run my presentation and slideshow\n- How to create your own version of this stack at home: which versions of Linux to use, packages, etc.\n- Hardware recommendations: adapters, interfaces, which you can take apart and which you can leave as is\n- Discuss how this stack makes for a cheap, affordable IoT stack for teaching IoT programming to kids (and in general!)\n- List of ideas for other projects and the future of this stack for creative applications\n- Discussion of things that could or should be improved\n- Other similar tech stacks that blend old and new to explore from here.\n- Lastly, I have a complimentary workshop based on the ideas in this talk that I've led a number of times. It's a little atypical as there's a hardware component I'd have to discuss with the organizers ahead of time, but I've managed to receive discounts and sponsorships from Adafruit on a couple occasions. Happy to discuss if there's interest or it makes me talk more appealing in some way!\n"

In this talk we'll explore this type of creative, interactive application development and look at the libraries, APIs, services, hardware and approaches to creating expressive works with JavaScript โ audio, visual and otherwise."

Brought over from popular classical object-oriented languages, they've not only been argued an unnecessary feature for JavaScript, but their usage can become actually harmful very easily. In this talk we'll take a look at the potential issues and pitfalls of using classes, like the need for context binding of methods, and suggest alternative patterns that are conceptually simpler, easier to work with, safer to use, more idiomatic, require less code and are actually more powerful."

        "talkAbstract": "Functional programming is a powerful design pattern for software development and is gaining momentum in the JavaScript community. Whether you are completely new to functional programming or have read introductory material on the subject and have begun to use the basics, you will eventually find yourself asking, โWhat next?โ This session will introduce function composition in JavaScript as a design pattern and as a problem solving tool. You will learn two of the most important tools for composition โ curry and compose โ discovering what they are and how they can be used to write modular functions. By slowly building on a single code example, this session will demonstrate the common thread of composition in functional programming, from piecing together simple functions to utilizing functors for even greater composability. If you want to dive deeper into functional programming, itโs time to embrace function composition!"

This is the same as when you have a bunch of well written functions that can be composed into even more powerful functions. \n\nThe characters respond to plot points like when, Spoilers, Dom finds out Letty is alive at the end of Fast 5. This is like events or triggers which call a function or a composition of functions in order to perform a task.\n\nAs well since all of the characters implement a common interface; driving a car; they can be easily deployed anywhere there are roads. Just like well our functions can be deployed to any serverless Faas container."

        "talkAbstract": "Getting application security right often requires that developers have a deeper than average understanding of the security domain. In what other industry is this the case? We don't have to be M.D.s to get a medical diagnosis; we don't have to be auto mechanics to get our cars fixed, yet we in security wag our fingers at \"iD10t errors\" and build grand mousetraps to catch \"so obvious\" developer missteps, when they may not know what they need to add, change or remove from their applications to make it \"secure\" in the first place. Furthermore, patterns to address these issues don't always fit the requirements of the application short or long term, resulting in solutions that only address part of the problem, or worse, are omitted altogether because they are too cumbersome to implement. My answer to this is _spartanโa node application created for developers of node.js applications, not security people. _spartan allows developers to create security policies which address their node app's (whether it be Desktop, Web, Mobile, IoT or API) specific requirements; it installs & configures the modules to match the policy and; it generates the boilerplate code that developers can import directly into their applications."
