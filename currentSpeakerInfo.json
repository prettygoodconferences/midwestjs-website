    "talkabstract": "Vue is a lightweight, fast and awesome library for building user interfaces. Its learning curve is gentle and its API is not complex to understand. OpenID Connect is a standards-based protocol for identity applications. Web apps are everywhere, and many tasks can be performed on the front-end now. However, not all tasks should be available to every user since each user is unique and perform different roles. Some users are admins with special privileges, some are normal users, and some are simply visitors (unauthenticated). Web apps should be smart enough to distinguish between the different types of user roles. In this talk, I will cover Role-Based Access Control in the frontend with practical examples you can start implementing in your applications immediately.",

    "talkabstract": "‚ÄúI tested it how you told me to,‚Äù ‚ÄúRequirements say it's expected,‚Äù ‚ÄúI assumed it's fine‚Äù ‚Äì these are the common phrases you hear when customer cases come up. Unfortunately, it is nothing unusual in our industry to be detached from customers' actual needs. As a result, teams regularly fail when they prioritize requirements over actual behaviour that the customers expect.\n\nThis problem of misaligned teams' focus is where Domain Driven Testing (DDT) comes into play. DDT helps developers to put themselves into the customers' shoes and see the product for what it is. This prioritization of the actual behaviour over the mere following of the requirements is what defines Domain Driven Testing.\n\nIn this talk, we discuss how knowledge of your company's domain (aka, the focus of your business) can improve your testing practices. We talk about Domain Driven Design techniques, Exploratory Testing, and other methods which emphasize software quality through customers' success. We touch bases on tools you can integrate into your system using Domain Driven Test Pyramid, and what common mistakes you should avoid when implementing Domain Driven Testing.\n",

    "talkabstract": "It is safe to say that Selenium WebDriver is the number one testing tool for many software engineers across the globe. However, as the tech world has been growing rapidly, so has the testing industry. More and more UI testing frameworks besides Selenium are gaining popularity. \n\nThese new test frameworks are especially appealing to its users because of the promise to solve speed, maintenance, development and other concerns of WebDriver implementations. These new, non-Selenium frameworks emphasize Rapid Test Development practices, and it has been resonating with the development community. \n\nIn this talk, we dive into test solutions evolved from Selenium like Protractor, and talk about non-Selenium frameworks like TestCafe and Cypress.io. We discuss why these new tools are gaining popularity and continue to disrupt the traditional testing standards of Selenium WebDriver. More importantly, we address how to get started and what mistakes to avoid when first implementing TestCafe or Cypress.io in your team.\n",

You want to encapsulate your features into isolated and self sufficient modules, and yet they must also be able to collaborate with other features.\n\nIf done right, your features will actually become miniature applications that simply plug-and-play!\n\nAs it turns out there are a number of hurdles to overcome in order to accomplish this. Rather than being left to fend for yourself, a new utility called feature-u (https://feature-u.js.org/) has already tackled these hurdles (check out this teaser: http://bit.ly/feature-u-teaser).\n\nThe \"Playful Features\" session will discuss how your features can exude a more playful nature ... in the sense that they plug-and-play!\n\nWith feature-u ...\n\n- your features can be encapsulated and isolated\n- they can collaborate with other features in an extendable way\n- your components can employ cross-feature composition (even injecting their content autonomously)\n- your features can initialize themselves\n- they can be activated or deactivated at run-time\n- and as a bonus, your frameworks will even auto-configure with only the active features (via a plugin architecture)\n\nIn short, your features can become more playful ... they can plug-and-play!\n\nfeature-u opens new doors into the exciting world of Feature-Based Development.

It's really quite a bit of fun and tends to spur attendee's imaginations, based on the feedback I've received. I'm always pleased when someone who saw my talk reaches out to share something interesting they've made!\n\nThe general outline for the talk typically looks like this:\n\n- Brief introduction about me and my talk\n- Brief introduction to Rasperry Pis/C.H.I.P. and other \"tiny\" computers.\n- Brief talk on the evolution of Node along that same timeline.\n- Brief talk about MIDI, what it solved\n- Brief talk about why MIDI and the event-driven nature of Node compliment one another.\n- A look at some of the packages and projects that make MIDI interfacing easy in Node.\n- Why it dovetails nicely with Node and also the Internet of Things\n- Why I chose this stack and decided to talk about it: background in music, interesting use for recycled music equipment.\n- Examples of IoT projects I've made using this tech stack of Tiny Computer, MIDI and JavaScript (#1)\n- Examples of IoT projects I've made using this tech stack of Tiny Computer, MIDI and JavaScript (#2)\n- Examples of IoT projects I've made using this tech stack of Tiny Computer, MIDI and JavaScript (#3)\n- Examples of IoT projects I've made using this tech stack of Tiny Computer, MIDI and JavaScript (#4)\n- Examples of IoT projects I've made using this tech stack of Tiny Computer, MIDI and JavaScript (#5)\n- A breakdown of how I'm using this stack to run my presentation and slideshow\n- How to create your own version of this stack at home: which versions of Linux to use, packages, etc.\n- Hardware recommendations: adapters, interfaces, which you can take apart and which you can leave as is\n- Discuss how this stack makes for a cheap, affordable IoT stack for teaching IoT programming to kids (and in general!)\n- List of ideas for other projects and the future of this stack for creative applications\n- Discussion of things that could or should be improved\n- Other similar tech stacks that blend old and new to explore from here.\n- Lastly, I have a complimentary workshop based on the ideas in this talk that I've led a number of times. It's a little atypical as there's a hardware component I'd have to discuss with the organizers ahead of time, but I've managed to receive discounts and sponsorships from Adafruit on a couple occasions.

    "talkabstract": "For a number of years now we have been hearing about all of the benefits that automated unit testing provides like increasing our quality, catching errors earlier, ensuring that all developers are testing in the same manner and deploying updates with high confidence that nothing will break. Testing a Web UI though was difficult and fragile which meant that typically we had no automated unit test for our Web UI. This is no longer the case with the latest release of Angular. Unit testing is now a first class citizen in Angular. \n\nOut of the box, the project generated by the Angular CLI has unit testing setup with Karma and Jasmine and includes sample tests. Generating new components, services, and pipes includes the unit test Spec file already wired up. Thus allowing you to focus on writing your unit tests and not on the infrastructure needed to get them running. The barriers to writing unit test have been destroyed. \n\nThis talk will walk through getting started unit testing your Angular components, services, and pipes. Along the way I will share the tips and tricks that I have learned as I have implemented unit testing on my Angular projects at a Fortune 100 company. You will walk away ready to immediately implement unit testing on your Angular project.",

While developers focus on automating their end-to-end flows with tools like Selenium,  when it comes to end-to-end visual testing, many are at a loss. It is even more apparent in the world of mobile development, where devices differ in their capabilities, display dimensions and even operating systems. Hence, visual testing is a must-have in the mobile market!\n\nIn this session, we discuss how to implement visual testing on mobile devices covering both native mobile (Android, iOS) and hybrid web development (React, React Native).
